# Subscription-Tracker

## Description
The **Subscription-Tracker** is a full-stack application designed 

Our task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This also comes with a unit test for each part.

There is a walkthrough video below that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing.

Technologies are listed below.
